# JAVA-bookstore-app
You are tasked with creating a Java application, given the template provided. Your task is to create
a customer application, where a customer can order books. Once an order has been placed, the
order needs to be shipped. Therefore, a shipping cost must be determined. Once complete, an
invoice for the order, including the shipping cost, needs to be generated. For example, a customer
can buy a book; and the book shop will then place the order. The shipping for the order must be
calculated and a shipping order generated. Finally, an invoice must be produced and all invoices
added to a repository. The repository can be used to search for an invoice. Further detail regarding
each class is now discussed.
